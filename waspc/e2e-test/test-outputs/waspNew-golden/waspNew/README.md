# Basic Wasp Starter
This is a barebones Wasp starter template. Read more about Wasp's features [in the docs](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs).

## Running it locally

Run:
```
wasp start
```

This will install all dependencies and start the client and server for you :)

## If you don't have Wasp installed

If you don't have Wasp installed, you can install it by running:
```
curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh
``` 

Run `wasp new <project-name> -t basic`. This will clone and set up the repo in the background.
